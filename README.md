Federate the web service found in this repository
as a SAML 2.0 Service Provider.

The IDP metatdata can be found here:

  * https://test-idp-o365.geant.org/saml2/idp/metadata.php


Be sure to ask for any support (for example, server-side configuration changes) that are needed to enable authentication of your Service Provider using our IDP.

In the end, you should be able to demonstrate that a user is required to successfully authenticate against our IDP in order to access the "/" resource.
